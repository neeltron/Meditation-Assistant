# MindRealm

When it comes to Mental Health, the power of meditation is often underestimated. According to the researchers, individuals that meditate on a regular basis have demonstrated higher focus and concentration, and significantly lower levels of stress and anxiety than individuals who don't meditate.

MindRealm is a personalized tool that is connected to an EEG headset to fetch meditation values from the user's brainwaves. Our Desktop Application allows the user to log in, meditate with relaxing music for as long as they want and even compete with their fellow zen enthusiasts to reach up the leaderboard.
